### Analysis Summary

# Codebase Overview Report

## High-Level Architecture
The project is a simple web application, primarily consisting of a single HTML file.

### **index.html**
*   **Purpose:** This file serves as the entry point for the web application. It contains the main structure and content that is displayed in a web browser.
*   **Internal Parts:** As a standard HTML file, it typically contains:
    *   HTML boilerplate (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
    *   Metadata within the `<head>` section (e.g., `<title>`, `<meta>` tags).
    *   Visible content within the `<body>` section (e.g., text, images, links).
*   **External Relationships:** Currently, this file appears to be self-contained with no explicit external dependencies (like linked CSS or JavaScript files) within the provided directory listing. It functions as a standalone web page.
    *   [Main HTML File](index.html)
